# **Williams doing a GitHub page**

I'm mostly trying to import a picture of my dog. 

![Branston](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Williams-Leith/images/master/IMG_0567.jpg "Branston") 

Not easy, because GitHub is complicated. **But I did it.** *Actually that's a lie. My friend Chris told me to add this code:*
```
(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Williams-Leith/images/master/IMG_0567.jpg
```
The `raw` and `githubusercontent.com` bits weren't in the github training, which was **_lacking_**. 

~~I keep making mistakes.~~ I'm getting the hang of this. You can only import `jpegs`.

## **Backwards and downwards!**

- [x] Let's do a list
- [ ] Organise things I want to do
- [x] Do a table
- [ ] Try a link.
- [x] Pretend I can write `code`

``` 
Python. My son can do stuff on python on his raspberry. 
Maybe I should subcontract him.
