# **Williams doing a GitHub page**

### Purpose
This page is mostly for me, Matthew Williams, to teach myself `Markdown` and some basics about GitHub.
This page might be interesting if you're trying to master Markdown yourself. 

To start with I'm mostly trying to import a picture of my dog.

Not easy, because GitHub is complicated. **But I did it.** *Actually that's a lie. My friend Chris told me to add this link:*

[See it here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Williams-Leith/images/master/IMG_0567.jpg)

The `raw` and `githubusercontent.com` bits weren't in the github training, which was **_lacking_**. 

When I told him it worked, he said,
> Cool. I've never even used this before!

_emoticon fail!_

~~I keep making mistakes.~~ I'm getting the hang of this. You can only import `jpegs`. **Note** I've added `alt text`. Hover mouse over pictures to reveal vital details.

## **Backwards and downwards!**

- [ ] Organise things I want to do
- [x] Do a table
- [x] Try a link.
- [x] Mess about with syntax
- [x] Pretend I can write `code`

``` 
Python. My son can do stuff on python on his raspberry. 
Maybe I should subcontract him.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes
