# **Welcome to Williams doing a GitHub page**

I'm mostly trying to import a picture of my dog. 
![Branston]
![Branston](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Williams-Leith/images/master/IMG_0567.jpg "Branston") 

Not easy, because GitHub is complicated. **But I did it.** 

## **Backwards and downwards!**

1. Let's do a list
2. Organise things I want to do
3. Do a table
4. Try a link.


Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Williams-Leith/Williams-Leith.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
